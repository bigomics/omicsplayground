R Style Guide
================

R is a high-level programming language used primarily for statistical
computing and graphics. The goal of the R Programming Style Guide is
to make our R code easier to read, share, and verify. Our style guide is
largely based on the following R Style Guides:

1. [Google's R Style Guide](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109l/unrestricted/resources/google-style.html)
2. [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
3. [Hadley Wickahm's style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)


File Names
---------------------

File names should end in .R and be meaningful. Some older files still
end with *.r. Files in the folder R are prefixed by category (gx-,
ngs-, pgx-) that mostly correspond to the analysis type and base input
object used. Do not use spaces or special characters ( ).

- GOOD: pgx-predictRevenue.R
- BAD: foo.R, predict_revenue.r


Identifiers
-----------------------

Don't use underscores hyphens (-) in
identifiers. Identifiers should be named according to the following
conventions. Variable names should have all lower case letters and
words separated with dots (.) or underscore (_); function names have
initial capital letters and no dots (CapWords); global constants are 
all caps (ALLCAPS).

* variables
  - GOOD: avg.clicks, avg_clicks
  - BAD: AveClicks
  
* FunctionNames
  - GOOD: CalculateAverageClicks
  - BAD: fcalculate_avg_clicks , calculateAvgClicks
    
Make function names verbs.
Exception: When creating a classed object, 
the function name (constructor) and class should match (e.g., lm).


Syntax
-----------------------
    

##### Indentation

When indenting your code, use two spaces. Never use tabs or mix tabs
and spaces.  _Exception: When a line break occurs inside parentheses,
align the wrapped line with the first character inside the
parenthesis._

##### Spacing

Place spaces around all binary operators (=, +, -, <-, etc.).
_Exception: Spaces around ='s are optional when passing parameters in
a function call._ Do not place a space before a comma, but always place one after a comma.

GOOD:

	tabPrior <- table(df[df$daysFromOpt < 0, "campaignid"])
	total <- sum(x[, 1])
	total <- sum(x[1, ])

BAD:

	tabPrior <- table(df[df$daysFromOpt<0, "campaignid"])  # Needs spaces around '<'
	tabPrior <- table(df[df$daysFromOpt < 0,"campaignid"])  # Needs a space after the comma
	tabPrior<- table(df[df$daysFromOpt < 0, "campaignid"])  # Needs a space before <-
	tabPrior<-table(df[df$daysFromOpt < 0, "campaignid"])  # Needs spaces around <-
	total <- sum(x[,1])  # Needs a space after the comma
	total <- sum(x[ ,1])  # Needs a space after the comma, not before

Place a space before left parenthesis, except in a function call

GOOD:

	if (debug)

BAD:

	if(debug)

Extra spacing (i.e., more than one space in a row) is okay if it improves alignment of equals signs or arrows (<-).

	plot(x = xCoord,
	y = dataMat[, makeColName(metric, ptiles[1], "roiOpt")],
	ylim = ylim,
   	xlab = "dates",
	ylab = metric, main = (paste(metric, " for 3 samples ", sep=""))

Do not place spaces around code in parentheses or square brackets.
Exception: Always place a space after a comma.

GOOD:

    if (debug)
	    x[1, ]

BAD:

    if ( debug )  # No spaces around debug
      x[1,]  # Needs a space after the comma


##### Curly Braces

An opening curly brace should never go on its own line; a closing
curly brace should always go on its own line. You may omit curly
braces when a block consists of a single statement; however, you must
consistently either use or not use curly braces for single statement
blocks.

    if (is.null(ylim)) {
    ylim <- c(0, 0.06)
    }
    xor (but not both)

    if (is.null(ylim))
      ylim <- c(0, 0.06)


Always begin the body of a block on a new line.

BAD:



    if (is.null(ylim)) ylim <- c(0, 0.06)
    if (is.null(ylim)) {ylim <- c(0, 0.06)}

##### Assignment
Use <-, not =, for assignment.

GOOD:
   
    x <- 5

BAD:

    x = 5

##### Semicolons

Do not terminate your lines with semicolons or use semicolons to put more than one command on the same line. (Semicolons are not necessary, and are omitted for consistency with other Google style guides.)




Organization
------------------------------------


##### General Layout and Ordering

If everyone uses the same general ordering, we'll be able to read and understand each other's scripts faster and more easily.

  1. Copyright statement comment
  2. Author comment
  3.File description comment, including purpose of program, inputs, and outputs
  4. ```source()``` and ```library()``` statements
  5. Function definitions
  6. Executed statements, if applicable (e.g., print, plot)
  7. Unit tests should go in a separate file named originalfilename_unittest.R.


##### Commenting Guidelines

Comment your code. Entire commented lines should begin with # and one space.

Short comments can be placed after code preceded by two spaces, #, and then one space.

    # Create histogram of frequency of campaigns by pct budget spent.
    hist(df$pctSpent,
    breaks = "scott",# method for choosing number of buckets
    main   = "Histogram: fraction budget spent by campaignid",
    xlab   = "Fraction of budget spent",
    ylab   = "Frequency (count of campaignids)")


##### Function Definitions and Calls

Function definitions should first list arguments without default values, followed by those with default values.

In both function definitions and function calls, multiple arguments per line are allowed; line breaks are only allowed between assignments.


GOOD:

    PredictCTR <- function(query, property, numDays,
    showPlot = TRUE)


BAD:
    
    PredictCTR <- function(query, property, numDays, showPlot =
    TRUE)



Ideally, unit tests should serve as sample function calls (for shared library routines).

Function Documentation
Functions should contain a comments section immediately below the function definition line. These comments should consist of a one-sentence description of the function; a list of the function's arguments, denoted by Args:, with a description of each (including the data type); and a description of the return value, denoted by Returns:. The comments should be descriptive enough that a caller can use the function without reading any of the function's code.

###### Example Function


    CalculateSampleCovariance <- function(x, y, verbose = TRUE) {
    # Computes the sample covariance between two vectors
    # Args:
    #   x: One of two vectors whose sample covariance is to be calculated.
    #   y: The other vector. x and y must have the same length, greater than one,
    #      with no missing values.```
    #   verbose: If TRUE, prints sample covariance; if not, not. Default is TRUE.
    #
    # Returns:
    #   The sample covariance between x and y.
    n <- length(x)
    # Error handling
      if (n <= 1 || n != length(y)) {
        stop("Arguments x and y have invalid lengths: ",
        length(x), " and ", length(y), ".")
      }
    if (TRUE %in% is.na(x) || TRUE %in% is.na(y)) {
        stop(" Arguments x and y must not have missing values.")
        }
        covariance <- var(x, y)
      if (verbose)
      cat("Covariance = ", round(covariance, 4), ".\n", sep = "") 
      
      return(covariance)

    }


###### TODO Style


Use a consistent style for TODOs throughout your code.


TODO(username): Explicit description of action to be taken



Language
------------------------------------

##### Attach
The possibilities for creating errors when using attach are numerous. Avoid it.

##### Functions
Errors should be raised using stop().

##### Objects and Methods
The S language has two object systems, S3 and S4, both of which are available in R. S3 methods are more interactive and flexible, whereas S4 methods are more formal and rigorous. (For an illustration of the two systems, see Thomas Lumley's "Programmer's Niche: A Simple Class, in S3 and S4" in R News 4/1, 2004, pgs. 33 - 36: http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2004-1.pdf.)

Use S3 objects and methods unless there is a strong reason to use S4 objects or methods. A primary justification for an S4 object would be to use objects directly in C++ code. A primary justification for an S4 generic/method would be to dispatch on two arguments.

Avoid mixing S3 and S4: S4 methods ignore S3 inheritance and vice-versa.

Exceptions
-----------------------------------

The coding conventions described above should be followed, unless there is good reason to do otherwise. Exceptions include legacy code and modifying third-party code.


Parting Words
-----------------------------------

Use common sense and BE CONSISTENT.


If you are editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style. If others use spaces around their if clauses, you should, too. If their comments have little boxes of stars around them, make your comments have little boxes of stars around them, too.



The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you are saying, rather than on how you are saying it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary. But local style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, the discontinuity will throw readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Try to avoid this. OK, enough writing about writing code; the code itself is much more interesting. Have fun!
