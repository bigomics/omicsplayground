## Task

Interpret the biological significance of the differential gene expression analysis results for the contrast **{{contrast}}** based on the data provided below.

## Analysis Overview

**Contrast:** {{contrast}}

**Phenotype:** {{phenotype}}

The differential expression analysis compares gene expression between the experimental conditions defined by this contrast. Positive logFC indicates upregulation in the first group relative to the second.

## Top Differentially Expressed Genes

The following genes show the strongest differential expression for this contrast:

{{top_genes}}

Focus on identifying:
1. The dominant functional themes among the top differentially expressed genes
2. How upregulated and downregulated genes relate to each other biologically
3. Potential mechanistic connections to the experimental contrast

## Summary Statistics

{{summary_stats}}

## Output Instructions

Always begin your summary with a heading in this exact format (maintain strict adherence):
**{{contrast}}** | Expression summary

Then synthesize the above information to explain:
- The primary biological processes activated or suppressed in this contrast
- How the top differentially expressed genes collectively support a coherent biological interpretation
- The biological relevance to the experimental phenotype
- Key driver genes and their known functions
- Use quantitative metrics to support your interpretation (cite specific logFC, q-values when available)
