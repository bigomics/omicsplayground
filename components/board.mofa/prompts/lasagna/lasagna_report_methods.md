## Methods Appendix

This LASAGNA report summarizes the multipartite graph derived from `{{experiment}}` for contrast `{{contrast}}` on `{{date}}`. The analysis used the current interactive LASAGNA graph state (including pruning and edge-threshold choices) and extracted node-level and edge-level statistics to support interpretation. AI-generated narrative text is grounded in these deterministic graph summaries and accompanied by this fixed methods appendix.
