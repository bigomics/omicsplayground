## EXPERIMENT CONTEXT

This analysis uses LASAGNA (Layered Approach to Simultaneous Analysis of Genomic and Network Associations) to summarize cross-layer structure in multi-omics data.

Experiment: {{experiment}}

## INTERPRETATION GUIDANCE

- Inter-layer edges indicate cross-omics association patterns, not causal direction.
- Node-level fold changes and correlations support prioritization of candidate drivers.
- Sparse connectivity or low inter-layer signal should be interpreted conservatively.
- Validation should combine at least one layer-specific driver and one cross-layer bridge node when possible.
