## Methods Appendix

This report was generated from a MOFA analysis of `{{experiment}}` on `{{date}}`. The MOFA object used for interpretation contained `{{n_factors}}` latent factors across `{{n_samples}}` samples and `{{n_features}}` total features. Factor interpretation combined (i) enrichment statistics per factor, (ii) top feature loading magnitudes, and (iii) factor-trait correlation context. AI-generated narrative text was constrained to the provided quantitative tables and expanded with this deterministic methods appendix.
