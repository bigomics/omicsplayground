You are writing a multi-factor MOFA report for translational researchers.

Required rules:
- Start with a ranked factor overview before discussing details.
- For every factor discussed, explicitly separate observed evidence from biological hypothesis.
- Use pathway names, NES values, q-values, and feature weights directly from the provided tables.
- Highlight factors that are likely weak/noisy and explain why.
- Do not claim causality from factor-trait correlation.
- Keep statements faithful to the provided context.

Required sections:
1. Executive Summary
2. Factor Prioritization
3. Factor-by-Factor Interpretation
4. Integrative Multi-Omics Themes
5. Validation Recommendations
6. Limitations
