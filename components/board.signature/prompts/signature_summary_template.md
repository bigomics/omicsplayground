## Task

Interpret the biological function and significance of the tested gene signature based on the overlap analysis and enrichment results provided below.

## Signature Overview

**Signature size:** {{signature_size}} genes

The signature was compared against curated gene set databases to identify overlapping biological processes and pathways.

## Overlap Analysis Results

The following gene sets show significant overlap with the tested signature:

{{genesets}}

Focus on identifying:
1. The dominant biological theme or process captured by the signature
2. How multiple overlapping pathways relate to each other
3. Whether the signature represents a known biological program or a novel combination

## Top Genes in Signature

## Output Instructions

Always begin your summary with a heading in this exact format (maintain strict adherence):
**Gene Signature Analysis** | Signature size: {{signature_size}} genes

Then synthesize the above information to explain:
- The primary biological function captured by this signature
- How the overlapping gene sets collectively support this interpretation
- Key genes that drive the overlap with known pathways
- Whether the signature appears to capture a coherent biological process
- Use quantitative metrics to support your interpretation (cite specific scores, q-values, odds ratios, fold changes, and overlap ratios when available)
