## Report Objective

Produce an expert-level PCSF report that prioritizes actionable network drivers while separating observations from hypotheses.

## Required Sections

1. Decision Snapshot
2. Contrast Ranking and Confidence Tiers
3. Top Hub Drivers by Contrast
4. Mechanistic Pathway Signals
5. Cross-contrast Convergence
6. Validation Next Steps
7. Limitations and Risk Notes

## Confidence Rules

- Use quantitative network metrics as confidence anchors.
- Mark contexts as data-limited when network size or hub support is weak.
- Qualify mechanistic interpretation when pathway overlap is absent.

## Language Rules

- Use language like "suggests", "is consistent with", and "prioritizes for follow-up".
- Do not claim proven causality or clinical efficacy.
- Keep uncertainty explicit when evidence is sparse.

## Actionability Rules

- Recommend concrete, feasible follow-ups tied to reported hubs/pathways.
- Include at least one orthogonal validation strategy.
