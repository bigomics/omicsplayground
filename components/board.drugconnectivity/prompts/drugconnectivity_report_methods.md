## Methods

This report summarizes pre-computed Drug Connectivity / DSEA outputs from Omics Playground.

For the present analysis, the experiment is "{{experiment}}" and the selected analysis type is "{{analysis_type}}", defined as follows: {{analysis_type_description}}. Drug-level connectivity is quantified using normalized enrichment scores (NES), nominal p-values, and false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted q-values. Within this framework, negative NES values are interpreted as opposing signatures and therefore support reversal hypotheses, whereas positive NES values are interpreted as mimicking signatures and therefore support mechanistic similarity hypotheses. Mechanism-of-action and molecular-target convergence are derived from enrichment over annotated perturbagen mechanisms and targets and are used to assess coherence of biological interpretation rather than to establish causality.

The methodological basis for network-level interpretation is aligned with systems biology approaches that use parsimonious connectivity principles, including the prize-collecting Steiner forest formulation [1].

All findings in this report are intended for hypothesis generation and prioritization and require orthogonal validation before biological or translational claims are made.
