## Report Objective

Produce an expert-level, translationally useful drug connectivity report that separates:
- opposing compounds (candidate signature reversal)
- mimicking compounds (biology-aligned perturbations)

## Required Sections

1. Decision Snapshot
2. Top Opposing Drugs
3. Top Mimicking Drugs
4. MOA Class Convergence
5. Molecular Target Convergence
6. Candidate Prioritization and Confidence
7. Validation Next Steps
8. Limitations and Translation Caveats

## Confidence Rules

- Treat q-values and significant-count metrics as primary confidence anchors.
- Use annotation coverage to qualify confidence.
- Explicitly mark data-limited contexts when annotation is sparse or significance is weak.

## Language Rules

- Use phrasing such as "suggests", "is consistent with", "prioritizes for follow-up".
- Do not claim proven efficacy, causality, or clinical benefit.
- Keep translational caveats explicit (L1000 cell line context, dose/time mismatch risk).

## Actionability Rules

- Propose concrete and feasible next steps (orthogonal transcriptomic checks, pathway assays, benchmark compounds).
- Keep recommendations tied to presented quantitative evidence.
