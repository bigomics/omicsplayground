Specifically, canonical Pearson's correlation between the selected {Gene} and all other available features is first computed on the log2-transformed (and normalized, by default) data using the core R stats package. The top N features are then identified as those exhibiting the highest average squared correlation value. A covariance matrix is calculated on the log2-transformed and normalized transposed data matrix (samples x top N features). Glasso is then applied on the covariance matrix to estimate a sparse inverse covariance matrix. A lasso (L1) regularization of 0.01 is applied. Using the function cov2cor from the Matrix R package, the partial correlation coefficient matrix is derived from the glasso-estimated inverse covariance matrix. Compared to canonical Pearson's correlation, partial correlation coefficients measure effect size and direction of the linear relationship between two variables while adjusting for potential confounding effects (indirect effects) of other variables, therefore providing an estimate of potential direct interactions.",
