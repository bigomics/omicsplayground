## Task

Interpret the biological themes and significance of keyword enrichment results for contrast **{{contrast}}** based on the enrichment analysis provided below.

## Contrast Overview

**Contrast:** {{contrast}}

The keyword enrichment analysis extracts frequently appearing words from enriched gene set names, providing an unbiased text-based summary of the biological processes affected in this comparison.

## Top Enriched Keywords

The following keywords show the strongest enrichment for this contrast:

{{top_keywords}}

## Keyword Statistics

{{keyword_stats}}

## Output Instructions

Always begin your summary with a heading in this exact format (maintain strict adherence):
**Keyword enrichment** | Contrast: {{contrast}}

Then synthesize the above information to explain:
- The dominant biological themes emerging from the keyword enrichment
- How multiple enriched keywords relate to each other to form coherent biological narratives
- The direction of enrichment (positive vs negative NES) and what it means for each group in the contrast
- Which keywords represent specific vs generic biological processes
- Use quantitative metrics to support your interpretation (cite specific NES values, adjusted p-values, and keyword sizes when available)
